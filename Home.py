### 📖 Customer Analytics with Machine Learning

Customer analytics is essential for businesses aiming to optimize revenue and retention.  
This project applies **machine learning models** to two critical problems:  

1. **Customer Value Regression** – Predicting the continuous value of customers.  
2. **Customer Churn Classification** – Predicting whether a customer will stay or leave.  

**Features considered include:**
- Call Failures & Complaints  
- Subscription Length & Status  
- Usage Patterns (Calls, SMS, Data)  
- Distinct Called Numbers  
- Age Group & Demographics  
- Tariff Plan & Charges  
- Customer Value Indicators  

These features enable accurate prediction of both customer value and churn risk.  

✅ **Modules Deployed:**  
- 📈 **Customer Value Regression** (continuous prediction)  
- 🅰️ **Customer Churn Classification** (binary prediction)  

🚀 **Skills & Tools Demonstrated:**  
- Machine Learning Models: Random Forest (Regression & Classification)  
- Python Libraries: pandas, joblib, scikit-learn  
- Interactive Deployment: Streamlit for user-friendly applications  
- Customer Analytics: Data-driven insights for **value management & churn reduction**
